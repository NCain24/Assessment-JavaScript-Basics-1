    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development 
    Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// ---------------Planning------------------
// --------Analysis of Requirements---------
// ----------------Design-------------------
// ------------Implementation---------------
// ----------Testing & Integration----------
// ---------------Maintain------------------

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the 
    Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of 
    each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, where one defines what the application is supposed to, as well as any needed features."
const design = "This is the third step. It is used to show how the application is meant to work, and how user input changes the user experience."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step. The application is written out."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step. Continuous testing is done to ensure that each part of the application is running smoothly with the other parts of the application."
const maintain = "This is the sixth and final step. After the application is deployed, more testing is done to discover any bugs that have made their way in to production."
